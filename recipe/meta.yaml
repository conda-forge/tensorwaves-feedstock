about:
  description: |
    TensorWaves is a fitter package that optimizes mathematical models to data
    samples. The models can be any _symbolic_ mathematical expression that is then
    converted to any computational backend. In addition, TensorWaves provides
    functionality to generate toy Monte Carlo data samples. The package is
    developed in parallel with [AmpForm](https://github.com/ComPWA/ampform), which
    implements physics models, but its 'lambdifying' mechanisms can in principle be
    used independently.

    All documentation can be found on
    [tensorwaves.rtfd.io](https://tensorwaves.readthedocs.io).
